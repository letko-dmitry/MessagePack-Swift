# MessagePack-Swift

A high-performance [MessagePack](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md) serializer/deserializer for Swift.

## Usage

```swift
import MessagePack

@MessagePackSerializable
struct Person {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
    let tags: [String]
}

let person = Person(id: 1, name: "Alice", tags: ["a"])
let data: Data = MessagePackSerializer.serialize(person)
let decoded = try MessagePackSerializer.deserialize(Person.self, from: data)
```

`serialize` is non-throwing and `deserialize` uses typed throws
(`throws(MessagePackError)`); the macro section below has the details and the
other routes (`Codable`, value tree).

## Comparison with other MessagePack libraries

`Benchmarks/Comparison` measures MessagePack-Swift against
[fumoboy007/msgpack-swift](https://github.com/fumoboy007/msgpack-swift),
[a2/MessagePack.swift](https://github.com/a2/MessagePack.swift),
[nnabeyang/swift-msgpack](https://github.com/nnabeyang/swift-msgpack), and
[gabriel/MPMessagePack](https://github.com/gabriel/MPMessagePack).

It is a **separate package** that depends on this one by path, so the libraries
it compares against never enter the dependency graph of MessagePack-Swift's own
consumers:

```sh
swift package --package-path Benchmarks/Comparison benchmark run
```

Each library encodes its own natural representation of the same logical
fixtures and decodes bytes it produced itself — libraries differ in which
formats they emit for a given value, so decoding a foreign payload would
measure those choices rather than the library under test. Codable-based routes
decode into typed structs; the "value tree" routes produce a MessagePack value
enum; MPMessagePack produces Foundation `NSArray`/`NSDictionary` objects.

## Macro: `@MessagePackSerializable`

The fastest route. The macro generates a `MessagePackSerializable` conformance
at compile time — direct wire-format reads/writes with no `Codable` container
machinery, no intermediate `MessagePackValue` tree, and no runtime reflection:

```swift
@MessagePackSerializable
struct Foo {
    let bar: Int
    let hoge: String
}

let foo = Foo(bar: 0, hoge: "")
let serialized: Data = MessagePackSerializer.serialize(foo)
let deserialized: Foo = try MessagePackSerializer.deserialize(Foo.self, from: serialized)
```

- Structs are serialized as maps keyed by property name, in declaration
  order — byte-identical to what the `Codable` route produces for an
  equivalent type, with one exception: a `nil` optional is written as an
  explicit MessagePack nil, where `Codable` synthesis (`encodeIfPresent`)
  omits the key. Either route decodes the other's output correctly, so they
  still interoperate freely.
- Decoding accepts fields in any order, skips unknown keys, throws
  `MessagePackError.missingField` for absent required fields, and uses the
  property's default value (or `nil` for optionals) when a field is absent.
  Field names are matched against the wire keys without ever materializing
  a key `String` (`MessagePackReader.readKey(matchedBy:)`): the generated
  matcher switches on the key length and compares the raw UTF-8 in 8-byte
  `UInt64` chunks against constants computed at expansion time (the
  automaton strategy MessagePack-CSharp uses), so a lookup costs one
  integer comparison per 8 bytes of key instead of a `memcmp` per
  candidate field. Unknown keys are still UTF-8-validated before being
  skipped. Serialization is precomputed the same way: the map header and
  each field name are emitted as constant words
  (`MessagePackWriter.writeRaw`), 8 bytes per store.
  Container nesting is limited to 128 levels (like the `Codable` route), so
  hostile input cannot drive unbounded recursion through recursively
  defined types.
- `@MessagePackKey("wire_name")` renames a field on the wire;
  `@MessagePackIgnored` excludes a stored property (the macro requires it
  to have a default value or be an optional `var`). Duplicate wire keys are
  rejected at compile time. Computed, `static`, and `lazy` properties are
  ignored; `let` properties with an initial value are written but not read
  back, matching `Codable` synthesis.
- Supported field types out of the box: `Bool`, all fixed-width integers,
  `Float`/`Double`, `String`, `Data` (bin), `Date` /
  `MessagePackTimestamp` (timestamp ext -1), `Optional`, `Array`, `Set`,
  `Dictionary` (any serializable key type, e.g. `Int` keys), nested
  `@MessagePackSerializable` types, generic structs (parameters are
  constrained automatically), and `MessagePackValue` for dynamically shaped
  fields.
- Enums with a raw value need no macro — declaring the conformance is
  enough (`enum Color: String, MessagePackSerializable`); a default
  implementation is provided for `RawRepresentable` types.
- Custom conformances can be written by hand against the public
  `MessagePackWriter` / `MessagePackReader` primitives. Both are
  noncopyable (`~Copyable`) — they own or borrow raw memory, so a copy
  escaping a conformance would be unsound, and the compiler now rejects it.
  When reading containers manually, balance each header read with
  `endContainer()`.
- `serialize` is non-throwing (single pass into a buffer that starts on
  the stack: a small result is copied into an exactly sized `Data`, a
  larger one is handed over without copying); unrepresentable values (strings/containers
  over MessagePack's 2^32-1 limits, dates outside the timestamp range) stop
  with a precondition failure, unlike the throwing `serialize(value:)` /
  `MessagePackEncoder` routes. `deserialize` uses typed throws
  (`throws(MessagePackError)`) and validates length claims against the
  remaining input before allocating.

| serialize structs (1k) | 55 µs | 651 µs | 1.52 ms | 3.08 ms |
| deserialize structs (1k) | 326 µs | 1.31 ms | 1.36 ms | 3.28 ms |
| round trip structs (1k) | 371 µs | 1.96 ms | — | — |
| serialize int array (10k) | 37 µs | 35 µs | — | — |
| deserialize int array (10k) | 33 µs | 34 µs | — | — |

## Codable

`MessagePackEncoder` / `MessagePackDecoder` mirror `JSONEncoder` / `JSONDecoder`:

```swift
struct Person: Codable {
    var id: Int
    var name: String
    var tags: [String]
}

let data = try MessagePackEncoder().encode(Person(id: 1, name: "Alice", tags: ["a"]))
let person = try MessagePackDecoder().decode(Person.self, from: data)
```

- Keyed containers become maps with string keys; maps with integer wire keys
  can be decoded through `CodingKey.intValue`.
- `Date` ↔ the spec's timestamp extension (ext type -1; numeric seconds are
  also accepted when decoding), `Data` ↔ bin 8/16/32, and
  `MessagePackTimestamp` ↔ ext type -1. Dates that cannot be represented as
  a timestamp (non-finite, out of `Int64` seconds range) throw
  `EncodingError.invalidValue`.
- Integers (and doubles that a float 32 holds exactly) encode with the
  smallest wire format; integers decode from any integer format that fits
  the requested type; out-of-range numbers (including float64 → `Float`
  overflow) throw instead of truncating. A float is a type mismatch for an
  integer type, even when it holds a whole number: the spec deserializes the
  float formats to its Float type and the int formats to Integer.
  `Int128`/`UInt128` encode when the value fits in 64 bits and throw
  `EncodingError.invalidValue` otherwise.
- `Decimal`, which MessagePack has no type for, goes through its own
  `Codable` conformance (a map of its fields) by default. As an option,
  `MessagePackEncoder(decimalEncodingStrategy: .convertToString)` writes a
  string of its exact digits (`"0.35"`, 5 bytes instead of about 60), and
  `MessagePackDecoder(decimalDecodingStrategy:)` takes the set of formats a
  `Decimal` is read from: `.deferredToDecimal` (the map, the default),
  `.convertFromString`, `.convertFromInteger`, and `.convertFromFloat`.
  Versions before the option cannot read the string.
- Duplicate map keys, which the spec leaves to implementations: the value
  tree and the macro route keep the last entry, while `Codable` (structs and
  dictionaries alike) looks each key up from the previous match onwards, so
  which entry a value gets depends on the order of the keys.
- Encoder output is byte-identical to `MessagePackSerializer.serialize` of
  the equivalent value tree (smallest headers everywhere).
- Both coders are `Sendable` (unchecked, value-semantic — like
  `JSONEncoder`, values placed in `userInfo` must be `Sendable` for
  cross-task use).
- Codable edge cases behave like `JSONEncoder`/`JSONDecoder`: repeated
  `container(keyedBy:)` requests merge into one map, a `superEncoder()`
  that is never used contributes nothing (its entry is written lazily on
  first use), `superDecoder()` for a missing key decodes as nil, and a
  value that encodes nothing throws. Because encoding is streaming, writes
  must be well nested — out-of-order writes to an already-closed container
  trap with a precondition failure instead of corrupting output. Decoding
  enforces a nesting-depth limit (128) against hostile input driving
  recursive `Decodable` types.

### Codable performance

Neither direction materializes a `MessagePackValue` tree:

- **Encoding** streams bytes into a growable buffer in a single pass.
  Container headers (counts unknown up front) are reserved at full width,
  counts are accumulated in the reserved bytes themselves, and headers are
  compacted to the smallest format in one final pass.
- **Decoding** walks the raw bytes directly. A keyed container scans its
  entries' byte offsets once and matches coding keys by comparing UTF-8
  bytes in place (no key `String` allocations), starting each lookup at the
  previous match so keys requested in wire order cost O(1). Container scans
  are memoized so a decoded value is never skipped twice.
- Values of natively represented types (integers, strings, floats, bools,
  `Date`/`Data`/timestamps) flowing through the generic
  `encode<T>`/`decode<T>` funnels are coded directly, bypassing the
  per-value `Encodable`/`Decodable` container machinery. Arrays of those
  scalar types (`[Int]`, `[String]`, `[Double]`, …) additionally bypass the
  unkeyed-container machinery entirely: a tight loop reads or writes the
  elements against the raw buffer, which puts them at macro-route speed —
  including when they appear as fields of a decoded struct. These array
  types are recognized by one out-of-line lookup of cached type
  identifiers, so every other value pays a single call for it.
- Hot paths avoid allocation: index coding keys build their `stringValue`
  lazily, coding paths are only materialized for errors and nested
  containers, decode primitives report failures via typed throws and attach
  coding-path context only when an error actually propagates, and the
  encoder's buffer sits behind a pointer to bypass dynamic exclusivity
  checks.

| Workload | MessagePackEncoder/Decoder | Foundation JSONEncoder/Decoder |

| encode int array (10k) | 35 µs | — |
| decode int array (10k) | 34 µs | — |

## Design notes

- **Spec compliance**: All format families are supported (fixint, fixmap, fixarray, fixstr, nil, bool, bin 8/16/32, ext 8/16/32, float 32/64, uint/int 8–64, fixext 1–16, str 8/16/32, array 16/32, map 16/32). The reserved byte `0xc1` and invalid UTF-8 in strings are rejected; as the spec asks, the original bytes of such a string stay readable through `MessagePackReader.readStringBytes()`. Timestamps round-trip through `.ext(type: -1, ...)`.
- **Smallest representation**: As recommended by the spec, integers serialize with the smallest format that represents the value, regardless of the case width (`.int64(5)` encodes as a 1-byte positive fixint), and a double that a float 32 holds exactly, bit for bit (`1.5`, `-0.0`, the infinities, the default NaN), as a 5-byte float 32 rather than a 9-byte float 64 on every route. Consequently, deserialization maps each wire format to the narrowest matching case (positive fixint → `.uint8`, negative fixint → `.int8`, `uint 16` → `.uint16`, float 32 → `.float32`, …); use the `int64Value` / `uint64Value` / `doubleValue` accessors for width-agnostic reads.
- **Iterative, not recursive**: Both directions use explicit frame stacks, so deeply nested input can never overflow the call stack. Deserialization enforces a nesting-depth limit (512) as DoS protection; serialization has no depth limit. The innermost container's state is kept in locals on both paths, so flat data never touches the stack arrays.
- **Single-pass serialization**: One streaming pass into a growable buffer that starts on the stack (doubling growth, so a large string/binary payload triggers at most one resize before its bulk copy); a result that outgrew the stack is handed to `Data` without copying, a smaller one is copied into an exactly sized `Data`. Length limits (strings/binary/containers beyond 2^32-1) are still validated inline with typed throws.
- **Zero-copy parsing**: The parser walks the raw bytes with unaligned big-endian loads; strings are built via `UTF8Span` (validate once, no revalidation) on OS 26+, falling back to `String(validating:)`. The availability check is resolved once per process, not per string.
- **Hostile input**: Length claims are checked against remaining input before allocating, so truncated or malicious headers (e.g. "4 GB string follows") fail fast without large allocations.

## Benchmarks

`Benchmarks/MessagePackBenchmarks` is a separate package (like the comparison
above) using [ordo-one/benchmark](https://github.com/ordo-one/benchmark), so the
benchmark harness and jemalloc never enter the dependency graph of this
package's consumers:

```sh
brew install jemalloc   # once
swift package --package-path Benchmarks/MessagePackBenchmarks benchmark
```

Same runner and metric as the
[comparison table](#comparison-with-other-messagepack-libraries) above,
produced by the
[MessagePackBenchmarks workflow](.github/workflows/messagepack-benchmarks.yml),
p50 wall clock:

| Workload | serialize | deserialize |
|---|---|---|
| small int array (64) | 875 ns | 542 ns |
| large int array (10k) | 71 µs | 58 µs |
| double array (10k) | 64 µs | 58 µs |
| string array (1k) | 24 µs | 80 µs |
| map (1k entries) | 105 µs | 76 µs |
| nested objects (500) | 325 µs | 336 µs |
| binary 1 MB | 27 µs | 21 µs |

Deserialization of a flat scalar array performs 1 allocation (the result array); serialization performs the output buffer's growth chain beyond its first kilobyte on the stack, plus the `Data` wrapper (about 8 allocations for a 10k-int array, independent of element count beyond the doubling; none but the `Data` for a small message).

## Testing

```sh
swift test
```

240 tests cover every format's byte-level encoding, boundary values (fixint/str/bin/array/map size class edges), Unicode, error paths (truncation, reserved bytes, invalid UTF-8, trailing bytes, depth limit), round-trip fidelity, the Codable layer (scalar extremes, nested/optional/enum/dictionary round trips, serializer interop, class inheritance via `superEncoder`, manual keyed/unkeyed/nested containers, decoding errors with full coding paths and byte offsets, `decodeIfPresent`, string-keyed dictionaries, `Decimal`, and 128-bit integers), differential checks that seeded random value trees encode byte-for-byte alike on the serializer, macro, and `Codable` routes, 20,000 seeded mutations of valid input that every decoder must reject or decode without crashing, and the macro layer (expansion snapshots, round trips for every supported field type, wire-format details, decoding robustness against reordered/unknown/duplicate/hostile input, and byte-for-byte Codable interop).
